# Mechanistic-Capitalism
What I call "_Mechanistic Capitalism_" is the understanding that while the whims of the market are incalculable, the performance of
an entity within the market and the measurments taken to rate that performance are not.  Call it _practically applied_ data-analysis.

The repository contains programmatic algorithms designed to showcase and implement data-analysis concepts in a __*live*__ environment.
Using platforms that provide API services, the system automates the handling of a widely diverse financial portfolio spread across
the traditional stock market, bitcoin, and even foreign exchange.
